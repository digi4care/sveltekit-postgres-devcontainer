# Project Structure Check

```yaml
prompt: |
    Check the project structure according to these guidelines:
    - Follow SvelteKit patterns and file-based routing
    - Use Svelte 5 syntax with runes for reactivity
    - Use the `@runed/svelte` package for advanced reactive patterns
    - Maintain clear separation between server and client components
    - Use kebab-case for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard)
```

## Usage

1. Open a directory or file
2. Type `/` and choose "Project Structure Check"
3. I will review the structure and suggest improvements
