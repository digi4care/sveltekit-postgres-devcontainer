# State Management Check

```yaml
prompt: |
    Check the state management according to these Svelte 5 guidelines:
    - Use `$state` for reactive state
    - Use `$derived` for derived values
    - Use `$effect` for side effects
    - Use `$props` for component props
    - Use `$bindable` for two-way binding
    - Consider using context for state shared across multiple components
    - Use the `@runed/svelte` package for advanced state management patterns
```

## Usage

1. Select code containing state management
2. Type `/` and choose "State Management Check"
3. I will review the code and suggest improvements following Svelte 5 best
   practices
