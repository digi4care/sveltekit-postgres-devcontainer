# TypeScript & Type Safety Check

```yaml
prompt: |
    Check TypeScript usage and type safety according to these guidelines:
    - Use TypeScript for all code
    - Prefer interfaces over types where possible
    - Avoid `any` and `enums`
    - Provide clear type annotations
    - Use generic types where appropriate
    - Ensure strict mode is enabled in tsconfig.json
    - Validate data at application boundaries using Zod
```

## Usage

1. Select TypeScript code or open a .ts or .svelte file
2. Type `/` and choose "TypeScript & Type Safety Check"
3. I will review the code and suggest improvements for better type safety
