# Forms & Data Fetching Check

```yaml
prompt: |
    Check forms and data fetching according to these guidelines:
    - Use SvelteKit's `load` functions for server-side data fetching
    - Use `fetch` with `$effect` for client-side data fetching
    - Use `@runed/svelte` form utilities for form handling
    - Use Zod for schema validation with Svelte 5 runes
    - Use `@attach` instead of `:use` for better type safety
    - Implement proper error handling and loading states
```

## Usage

1. Select code containing forms or data fetching logic
2. Type `/` and choose "Forms & Data Fetching Check"
3. I will review the code and suggest improvements
