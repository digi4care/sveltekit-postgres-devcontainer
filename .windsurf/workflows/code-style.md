# Code Style Check

```yaml
prompt: |
    Check the code style of the current files according to these guidelines:
    - Follow the Airbnb Style Guide for code formatting
    - Use PascalCase for Svelte 5 component file names (e.g., UserCard.svelte)
    - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)
    - Keep files structured: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types
```

## Usage

1. Open a file or select code
2. Type `/` and choose "Code Style Check"
3. I will review the code and suggest improvements
