# Introduction

[Runes](https://runed.dev/) are magic, but what good is magic if you don't have
a wand?

[Runed](https://runed.dev/) is a collection of utilities for Svelte 5 that make
composing powerful applications and libraries a breeze, leveraging the power of
[Svelte Runes](https://svelte.dev/blog/runes).

## Why Runed?

[Svelte 5 Runes](https://svelte.dev/blog/runes) unlock immense power by
providing a set of primitives that allow us to build impressive applications and
libraries with ease. However, building complex applications often requires more
than just the primitives provided by Svelte Runes.

[Runed](https://runed.dev/) takes those primitives to the next level by
providing:

- **Powerful Utilities**: A set of carefully crafted utility functions and
  classes that simplify common tasks and reduce boilerplate.
- **Collective Efforts**: We often find ourselves writing the same utility
  functions over and over again. Runed aims to provide a single source of truth
  for these utilities, allowing the community to contribute, test, and benefit
  from them.
- **Consistency**: A consistent set of APIs and behaviors across all utilities,
  so you can focus on building your projects instead of constantly learning new
  APIs.
- **Reactivity First**: Powered by Svelte 5's new reactivity system, Runed
  utilities are designed to handle reactive state and side effects with ease.
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support to catch errors early and provide a
  better developer experience.

## Ideas and Principles

### Embrace the Magic of Runes

[Svelte Runes](https://svelte.dev/blog/runes) are a powerful new paradigm. Runed
fully embraces this concept and explores its potential. Our goal is to make
working with Runes feel as natural and intuitive as possible.

### Enhance, Don't Replace

[Runed](https://runed.dev/) is not here to replace Svelte's core functionality,
but to enhance and extend it. Our utilities should feel like a natural extension
of Svelte, not a separate framework.

### Progressive Complexity

[Runed](https://runed.dev/) aims to provide solutions that scale with your
needs. Start simple with basic utilities and progressively adopt more advanced
patterns as your application grows in complexity.

### Open Source and Community Collaboration

[Runed](https://runed.dev/) is an open-source, MIT licensed project that
welcomes all forms of contributions from the community. Whether it's bug
reports, feature requests, or code contributions, your input will help make
Runed the best it can be.
